But Nuxt is designed for building applications, while VuePress is more lightweight and focused on content-centric static sites.</p></div><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">VitePress</p><p>VitePress is the little brother of VuePress. It&#39;s also created and maintained by our Vue.js team. It&#39;s even more lightweight and faster than VuePress. However, as a tradeoff, it&#39;s more opinionated and less configurable. For example, it does not support plugins. But VitePress is powerful enough to make your content online if you don&#39;t need advanced customizations.</p><p>It might not be an appropriate comparison, but you can take VuePress and VitePress as Laravel and Lumen.</p></div><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Docsify / Docute</p><p>Both are great projects and also Vue-powered. Except they are both fully runtime-driven and therefore not SEO-friendly. If you don’t care for SEO and don’t want to mess with installing dependencies, these are still great choices.</p></div><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Hexo</p><p>Hexo has been serving the Vue 2.x docs well. The biggest problem is that its theming system is static and string-based - we want to take advantage of Vue for both the layout and the interactivity. Also, Hexo’s Markdown rendering isn’t the most flexible to configure.</p></div><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">GitBook</p><p>We’ve been using GitBook for most of our sub project docs. The primary problem with GitBook is that its development reload performance is intolerable with a large amount of files. The default theme also has a pretty limiting navigation structure, and the theming system is, again, not Vue based. The team behind GitBook is also more focused on turning it into a commercial product rather than an open-source tool.</p></div>',6);function k(V,x){const o=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return i(),s("div",null,[l,t("p",null,[e("VuePress is a markdown-centered static site generator.
