# Theme

VuePress theme can provide layouts, styles and many other features for you, helping you to focus on writing Markdown content.

## Default Theme

VuePress provides a default theme, which is applied to our documentation site you are currently browsing.

You need to import and use it in your config file via the [theme](../reference/config.md#theme) option:

```ts
import { defaultTheme } from '@vuepress/theme-default'
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'

export default defineUserConfig({
  theme: defaultTheme({
    // default theme config
    navbar: [
      {
        text: 'Home',
        link: '/',
      },
    ],
  }),
})
```

The default theme provides basic but useful features for documentation site, you can check out [Default Theme Config Reference](https://ecosystem.vuejs.press/themes/default/config.html) for a full list of config.

However, you might think it is not good enough. Or, you want to build a different type of site, for example, a blog, instead of a documentation. Then, you can try to use a community theme or create a local theme.

## Community Theme

Community users have created lots of theme and published them to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:vuepress-theme). You should check the theme's own documentation for detailed guide.

You can explore more themes in [VuePress Marketplace](https://marketplace.vuejs.press/themes/).

## Local Theme

If you want to use your own custom theme but don't want to publish it, you can create a local theme. Refer to [Advanced > Writing a Theme](../advanced/theme.md) for how to write your own theme.
